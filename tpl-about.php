			<h2>Design is just a piece of the puzzle</h2>

			<p>Design is more that pretty colors. It goes well into physiology, marketing, strategy and pretty much anything that has to do with your business and people in general.</p>
			<p>As Wikipedia defines it “Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction.”</p>

			<h2>Why should you even care?</h2>

			<p>The internet has it's own notion of time and it passes so fast it’s hard to believe. As time passes it becomes nosier and noisier.</p>
			<p>This means that getting noticed, getting attention and keeping that attention gets harder and harder. Also, more expensive.</p>
			<p>What you could achieve for free a few years back, you need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars these days. It will only get worse as more and more people and businesses start fighting for that attention.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>All of this means that you will spend resources in form of time and money to get the in front of the people that you are looking to reach. </p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>And when you get there, you don’t want to be caught in your pajamas, right?</p>
			<p>You want to be prepared. You want to get the most out of what you spent already.</p>
			<p>This is what I can do for you, I can prepare your digital presence for the people you spent your resources trying to get to.</p>
